# **Task Management Dashboard**

This is a simple **Task Management Dashboard** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. You can use it to manage tasks, add new ones, edit existing ones, and delete them. It also includes a filter to view tasks by their completion status.

## **Features:**
- **Add**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks
- **Filter tasks** by status (Pending or Completed)
- All tasks are saved in the browser's **local storage**, so they persist even after page reloads

## **Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mamaaak/task-management-dashboard.git

3. **Open the project folder** in your code editor.

4. Right-click on **index.html** and select **"Open with Live Server"** to run the project.
